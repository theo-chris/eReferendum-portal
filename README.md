# eReferendum-portal (eRP)
A web-based application developed in HTML,Java Servlets/JSP and MySQL.

It is an application for citizens to register and vote in a referendum.

1. Citizens must be over 16.
2. They must provide a BIC code, which can be used once.
3. The application is made for only a population of 10 people (unrealistic)

One admin (or Election Commission) account exists, and the admin can start/stop/edit the referendum.
